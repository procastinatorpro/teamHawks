<h4><em>Glance at the History</em></h4>
It was all new then into the world of karting, when the first ever team of the Hawks, <b>Hawks 2.0</b> went into the game of karting under the competiton name
Ecokart Series 2015. We were too young then to explore the opportunities but with the faith and believe of doing something great, which had led the team to
strike one of the title there and had won INR 10,000 at the very first attempt by the team into the game of e-karting.<br>
It was a huge achievement for the team. It was not about the prize and fame, moreover it was about the discovery of the 
passion we were having which had made us sail through all the fears and failures we encountered, forth that passion, persistence and the fierce of
thudding the race tracks made the team, <b>Team Hawks!</b>.<br>
The same Legacy got continued further...
